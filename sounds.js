    make an array with the words that have to be shown and played.
    eg.
    wordList = [0,1,2]
    for "Which is the"
    now, the bugger is, how do I do the colour and shape?
    multi array?
    might not be needed, since every time will be either,
    "Where is the", or "That is a" or, "Yes. That is the",
    followed by the color of the object,
    followed by the shape of the object.
    Later, I can also add how many of them there are, and make smaller
    versions of the shapes to fit more than one in a slot.

    Would I need this though? I could just set up delayed audiobuffers
    for all of the words. however, if I did that, I wouldn't know when
    
    debugger;

    right, how about copying all of the words into the wordList array?

    wordList[1] = {word:'yes!', start:7, duration:1};
